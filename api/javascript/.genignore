# Preserve custom files during SDK regeneration
# Note: Removed examples/ to allow Speakeasy to regenerate it properly

# NOTE: CustomerPortal.ts is NOT preserved because it was written for 
# the old OpenAPI Generator structure and is incompatible with Speakeasy.
# TODO: Rewrite CustomerPortal for Speakeasy SDK structure
