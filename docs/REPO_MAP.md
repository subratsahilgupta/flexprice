# FlexPrice repository map

This document is repository **census and orientation**: where major systems live, how they relate, and who “owns” which boundaries. Pair with [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), [`DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`](DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md), and [`FLOWS/`](FLOWS/).

**Maintenance:** After structural changes (new packages, deployment modes, major routes, or pipelines), update this file in the same PR when practical.

---

## Executive summary

FlexPrice is a **Go monolith** (Gin HTTP + Uber Fx DI) that can split by **deployment mode** into API-only, Kafka consumer-heavy, Temporal worker, or admin-portal processes. Persistence is **PostgreSQL (Ent)** for transactional state and **ClickHouse** for high-volume metering/analytics paths. **Kafka** feeds Watermill-backed consumers; **Temporal** orchestrates billing, invoicing sync, exports, and cron-style schedules.

---

## Entrypoints

| Entry | Role |
| ----- | ---- |
| `cmd/server/main.go` | Sole application binary: wires Fx modules, registers HTTP handlers, starts pub/sub router (optional), Temporal workers (optional), Gin server |
| `cmd/migrate/main.go` | Database migration tooling (separate binary) |

There is **no separate `consumer` binary** in `cmd/`; consumer behavior is activated via `FLEXPRICE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` (see `internal/types` and `cmd/server/main.go`).

---

## Deployment modes (logical services)

Controlled by configuration (`deployment.mode`). Same codebase, different runtime responsibilities:

| Mode | HTTP API | Kafka message router / handlers | Temporal workers |
| ---- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `local` (default) | Yes | Full processing registrations | Yes |
| `api` | Yes | Router runs; ingestion handlers **not** registered | No |
| `consumer` | No | Full processing registrations | No |
| `temporal_worker` | No | Minimal (webhook/integration paths for activity-side publishing) | Yes |
| `admin` | Admin portal API only. Public API is not mounted | No | No |

### Admin portal

`admin` (`make run-local-admin`, `FLEXPRICE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=admin`) is the backend for the internal admin portal. Flexprice staff use it to manage tenant accounts and settings — users, environments, and the rest of tenant-scoped administration — without exposing those operations on the customer API.

It is its own Gin engine and its own packages, extended the same way as the public API:

| Piece | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Router and `Handlers` | `internal/api/admin` (`provideAdminHandlers`, `provideAdminRouter` in `cmd/server/main.go`) |
| Handlers | `internal/api/admin/v1` |
| DTOs | `internal/api/dto/admin` (shared enums come from `internal/types`) |
| Services | `internal/ee/service/admin` (constructed with `service.ServiceParams`) |

These routes stay out of the public OpenAPI spec and the generated SDKs.

`/v1` requires `X-Admin-Secret`, checked against `admin.secret` (`FLEXPRICE_ADMIN_SECRET`). `/health` stays open for probes. The secret authorizes the caller; naming a tenant by id or email is still cross-tenant on purpose. Per-operator RBAC and an audit log of actions are not built yet. Keep this process off the public internet.

Implementation reference: `startServer`, `registerRouterHandlers`, `includeProcessingHandlers` in `cmd/server/main.go`.

## Layer map (canonical directions)

Approved dependency flow (conceptual):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  cmd["cmd/server"]
  api["internal/api (+ rest/middleware, dto)"]
  svc["internal/ee/service"]
  dom["internal/domain"]
  repo["internal/repository"]
  infra["postgres, clickhouse, kafka, pubsub, temporal, integration, webhook"]
  ee["internal/ee"]
  cmd --> api
  cmd --> svc
  api --> svc
  svc --> dom
  svc --> repo
  repo --> dom
  repo --> infra
  svc --> infra
  api --> infra
```

- **Domain** (`internal/domain/*`): Models and repository **interfaces only** — no Implementations importing Ent.
- **Repository** (`internal/repository/*`): PostgreSQL via **Ent generated code** under `repository/ent/`, analytics via **`repository/clickhouse/`**.
- **Service** (`internal/ee/service/*`): Business orchestration; primary consumer of domain interfaces and infrastructure facades.
- **API** (`internal/api/v1`, `internal/api/cron` — one remaining legacy trigger, `internal/api/dto`): HTTP adapters; validates and maps DTOs; **no duplicated business rules**.
- **Admin portal** (`internal/api/admin`, `internal/api/dto/admin`, `internal/ee/service/admin`): operator API for tenant accounts and settings. Served only when `deployment.mode=admin`. Not part of the public API.
- **Enterprise** (`internal/ee/`): Commercial features layered on core; services composed in Fx alongside open-core services (`cmd/server/main.go`).

| Cron HTTP trigger | `internal/api/cron/` | Legacy manual `/v1/cron/invoices/void-old-pending` trigger (no Temporal equivalent); all other cron-style jobs run as Temporal schedules |

## Data stores and pipelines

### PostgreSQL (transactional)

- **ORM:** Ent (`ent/schema/*` → generated `repository/ent/*`).
- Core aggregates: tenants, environments, users, customers, plans, prices, subscriptions, invoices, payments, wallets, coupons, addons, integrations, secrets, workflows, scheduled tasks, etc.

### ClickHouse (metering / analytics)

- Consumption services write/query via `repository/clickhouse/` (events, processed events, feature usage, cost sheet usage, meter usage, raw events, benchmarks).
- Migrations under `migrations/clickhouse/`.

### Kafka topics (from `internal/config/config.yaml`)

Representative configured topics:

- **`events`** — primary usage event stream after API ingest / publish pipeline.
- **`events_lazy`** — deferred/low-priority processing path.
- **`events_backfill`** — replay/backfill inputs.
- **`events_post_processing`** (+ backfill variant) — post-processing stage.
- **`events_dlq`** — dead-letter when configured for the Watermill router.
- **`flexprice_system_events`** (webhook/system event bus naming in config sections).
- **`wallet_alert`**, benchmarking topics, **`onboarding_events`**, transform pipeline topics (staging-oriented keys in yaml).

Exact binding is **per config section** (event processing vs webhook vs integration events); trace `RegisterHandler` calls in services and `webhook`/integration modules.

---

## Important modules / relationships

### Fx composition hub

`cmd/server/main.go` centralizes construction order:

1. Infrastructure: logger, Postgres, ClickHouse, Kafka producer/consumer, cache, optional DynamoDB/S3.
2. All `repository.New*` constructors.
3. **`webhook.Module`** then **`integrationevents.Module`** (webhook-shaped system events pipeline).
4. **Service constructors** (+ `internal/ee/service` overlays).
5. Temporal client/worker/service + **`api` handlers + Gin router.**

### Temporal

- **`internal/temporal/registration.go`** registers workflows/activities onto task queues derived from **`internal/types`** task queue helpers.
- **Schedules**: `EnsureSchedules` runs on Temporal worker startup — cron-like automation prefers Temporal over naked OS cron.
- Activities often call back into **`internal/ee/service`** and **`internal/integration`**.

### Billing core (high cohesion, large files)

- **`internal/ee/service/subscription.go`**, **`invoice.go`**, **`billing.go`** — primary subscription/invoice/rating surfaces (see [`HOTSPOTS.md`](HOTSPOTS.md)).

### Generated code

- **Do not hand-edit** `internal/repository/ent/*` (Ent codegen), large portions of **`api/*/generated`**, etc. Prefer schema + codegen + merge-custom for SDKs.

## Ownership boundaries (team mental model)

| Boundary | Contracts | Consumers |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Metering ingestion** | Event API → publisher → Kafka → consumption → ClickHouse | Billing, dashboards, exports |
| **Billing / subscription** | Domain invariants + invoice generation | Payments, integrations, Temporal |
| **Integrations** | Provider-specific clients + webhook HTTP handlers under `integration/*/webhook` | Services, Temporal activities |
| **Outbound notifications** | `webhook/` pipeline + Svix (`internal/svix`) | Customers, portals |
| **Platform / tenancy** | Tenant, environment, RBAC, secrets | All handlers |
