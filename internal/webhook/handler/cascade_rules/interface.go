// CascadeRule reacts to a fixed set of source events and produces follow-on ("cascaded")
// events, constrained to a declared set of target events. Rules are registered into an
// EventCascader, which statically validates that the source→target edges form no cycle.
//
// A proxy event (one that has its own webhook, e.g. entitlement.*) uses a CascadeRule to
// produce follow-on events (e.g. subscription.updated). Surfaces with no proxy event of
// their own emit their subscription.updated directly at the mutation site — there is
// nothing to cascade from.

	// validated against this set, and the set feeds the static cycle check.

	// GetEventsToCascade returns zero or more follow-on events for a matched source event.
	// Best-effort: it never returns an error, so it cannot fail delivery of the source event.
