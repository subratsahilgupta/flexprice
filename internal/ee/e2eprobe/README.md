# E2EProbe API Probe

A long-running synthetic monitor that exercises Flexprice's public APIs against one fixed tenant/environment, asserting correctness across CRUD, event ingestion → analytics, event → wallet debit, cancel → invoice, auto-generated billing-cycle invoices, and webhook delivery.

## Quick start

```bash
export E2EPROBE_API_HOST=https://api.cloud.flexprice.io/v1
export E2EPROBE_API_KEY=<key for the e2eprobe tenant>
export E2EPROBE_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<optional>
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<optional, e.g. signoz-otel:4317>
make run-e2eprobe
```

## Self-provisioning

`seed-ensure` is fully self-contained — no manual tenant prep is required. On first run (or any run where entities are missing) the harness idempotently provisions:

1. **12 features** (each with an embedded meter): 8 baseline aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, COUNT_UNIQUE, LATEST, MAX, SUM_WITH_MULTIPLIER, SUM/api-filter), 3 bucketed meters (MAX/15MIN, SUM/HOUR, MAX/DAY) for the bucketed-meter-probe, and `e2eprobe_sum_commit` for commitment-true-up-probe — the last one carries no entitlement, so billed usage is exactly units x price with no allowance absorbing the first $1.00.
2. **1 shared coupon** (`E2EPROBE_COUPON_10PCT`, 10% percentage, one-time cadence) reused by coupon-application-probe and attached to persistent cust #1's sub.
3. **1 shared tax rate** (`E2EPROBE_TAX_10PCT`, 10% percentage, EXTERNAL scope) reused by tax-application-probe and attached to persistent cust #0's sub.
4. **10 persistent customers** tagged `metadata.e2eprobe_cohort = "persistent"`.
5. **1 plan** (`e2eprobe_plan`) with metadata `e2eprobe = "true"`.
6. **13 prices** attached to the plan: 1 base recurring fixed fee ($19.99/mo) + 1 usage price per feature ($0.01/unit).
7. **7 plan-level soft-limit entitlements**: one on each non-bucketed metered feature EXCEPT `e2eprobe_sum_multiplier_feature` (reserved for the additive grant, see next bullet) and `e2eprobe_sum_commit_feature` (entitlement-free by design).
8. **1 additive grant entitlement** on `e2eprobe_sum_multiplier_feature` (grant_measure=quantity, quota=1000, duration=1 hour, aggregation_mode=additive). Post-create config-echo verified at seed time via raw HTTP GET, since SDK v2.0.24 doesn't expose grant fields on `EntitlementResponse`.
9. **10 subscriptions** — one per persistent customer — on the e2eprobe plan (monthly, anniversary cycle). New subs carry a $5/mo commitment (1.5× overage factor); cust #1's sub additionally carries the shared coupon via SubscriptionCoupons. Draft subscriptions are activated automatically.
10. **1 tax association** linking the shared tax rate to persistent cust #0's subscription (idempotent — covers both new and existing subs).
11. **3 wallets** on the first 3 persistent customers (`e2eprobe-cust-persistent-0/1/2`), each topped up to $100.00 USD.

Subscription line items snapshot the plan at create time, so a feature seeded
after the persistent subs were created is invisible to every usage read path
(they filter by active-subscription line items). `seed-ensure` detects that
drift and triggers the plan price sync; `meter-aggregation-probe` skips any
meter that isn't yet on the customer's subscription rather than paging.

Every step is idempotent: re-running seed-ensure against a tenant that already has all entities is a no-op.

## Airgapped bootstrap

An airgapped deployment has no dashboard and no existing key, so there is no way
to provision `E2EPROBE_API_KEY` up front. Supply `E2EPROBE_EMAIL` and
`E2EPROBE_PASSWORD` instead and the probe provisions its own:

1. `POST /auth/signup` — on `409 already_exists`, falls back to `POST /auth/login`.
2. `GET /environments` — signup creates exactly one.
3. `POST /secrets/api/keys` — mints a private key.
4. Patches the key into the Secret named by `E2EPROBE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET_NAME`.

An explicit `E2EPROBE_API_KEY` always wins, so existing deployments are
unaffected. Enable it in the chart with `e2eprobe.bootstrap.enabled=true`, which
also mounts the ServiceAccount token and creates a Role scoped by name to that
one Secret (`get` and `patch` only).

**Requires the flexprice-native auth provider** (`auth.provider: "flexprice"`,
the chart default). Supabase-backed deployments reject signup with 403/500, and
a tenant enforcing SSO refuses password login. The probe reports both cases
explicitly rather than as a bare status code.

**Restarts do not mint a second key.** Bootstrap reads the Secret first and
reuses a stored key. This matters because environment variables resolve at
container start: a restart inside the same pod re-reads the original empty
value, so without the read a crash loop would mint keys indefinitely — and
nothing revokes them.

**Outside Kubernetes** (`make run-e2eprobe`, plain Docker) there is no Secret to
write, so the credential is logged once instead; otherwise it would be lost.
In-cluster the key is never logged.

### Deploying the probe on its own

To install a probe-only release — useful for testing bootstrap without touching
an existing deployment — disable the chart's two hook Jobs as well as the app
components. Both block the install otherwise: the migration Job runs
`pre-install` and the Temporal namespace Job runs `post-install`, and each hangs
waiting for infrastructure a probe-only release does not deploy.

```bash
helm install <release> . -n <namespace> \
  --set migration.enabled=false \
  --set temporalConfig.enabled=false \
  --set api.enabled=false --set consumer.enabled=false \
  --set worker.enabled=false --set frontend.enabled=false \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false --set kafka.enabled=false \
  --set clickhouse.enabled=false --set temporal.enabled=false \
  --set e2eprobe.enabled=true --set e2eprobe.bootstrap.enabled=true \
  --set e2eprobe.env.E2EPROBE_API_HOST=https://<region>.api.flexprice.io/v1
```

The probe reaches the API over HTTPS and needs no database of its own, so
skipping the migration Job is safe here — do not skip it for a real deployment.

## Architecture

The harness is built around three abstractions:

- **`Check`** — base interface (Name + Kind + Run). Every unit of work is a Check.
- **`Scheduler`** — controls when a Check runs. Four concrete: `Ticker`, `Rate`, `OneShot`, `Listener`.
- **`Runner`** — owns the Reporter, panic recovery, OTEL spans.

Adding a new probe: write `internal/ee/e2eprobe/checks/<name>.go` implementing `Check`; register in `cmd/e2eprobe/main.go` with the appropriate Scheduler.

## Webhook pipeline verification (low-balance-alert-probe + low-wallet-alert-listener)

The listener exposes `POST http://<e2eprobe-host>:8765/webhook` (port configurable). Flexprice must be pointed at that URL — either via `webhook.tenants.<tenant_id>.endpoint` in the Flexprice config (native HTTP delivery) or via a Svix endpoint subscribed to `wallet.credit_balance.dropped` / `wallet.ongoing_balance.dropped` (when Svix is enabled).

`seed-ensure` provisions a dedicated `e2eprobe-cust-alert-canary` persistent customer with one wallet initially topped up to **$30** and alert thresholds `{info=25, warning=10, critical=0}` all enabled. The three pre-funded seed wallets carry the same thresholds but sit at $100 with no draining — they exist as a safety net only.

`low-balance-alert-probe` alternates between two legs on the canary wallet:

1. **Drop leg** (wallet state = `ok`): ingest one `e2eprobe_sum` event (default `amount=600`, priced at `$0.01/unit` = `$6.00` of current-period usage) to push ongoing balance below the info threshold, then poll the listener's receipt map for up to **2 minutes**. This grace absorbs typical Kafka + Svix/native-HTTP propagation delay; only truly missing webhooks page.
2. **Recovery leg** (wallet state = `in_alarm`): top-up back to `$30` so Flexprice's binary alert state machine can re-arm.

A missing webhook in the drop leg fails the check → routes through the standard reporter chain → posts to Slack. Full cycle time at defaults: 10 minutes per verification.

## Operational signals

Every `E2EPROBE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default 1 hour) the probe emits a single structured log line summarising activity since startup:

```json
{"level":"info","time":"2026-06-12T10:05:00.000Z","msg":"e2eprobe heartbeat","event":"e2eprobe.heartbeat","run_id":"e2eprobe-1749720000","uptime":"5m0s","total_runs":142,"total_failures":0,"success_rate":"100.00%","check.analytics-probe":"3/3","check.event-ingest-driver":"125/125","check.wallet-balance-probe":"3/3"}
```

One line per tick — not per check. Key fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `uptime` | Time since process started |
| `total_runs` | All check executions (successes + failures) |
| `total_failures` | Executions that returned an error or panicked |
| `success_rate` | `(total_runs - total_failures) / total_runs × 100` |
| `check.<name>` | `successes/total` for that individual check |

**When to be concerned about silence:** If a heartbeat is missing for more than two intervals (2 hours at default settings) the process has likely crashed or lost its log pipeline. Alert on the absence of `event=e2eprobe.heartbeat` in your log aggregator.

Set `E2EPROBE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=0` to disable heartbeat logging entirely.

## Failure surfacing

Failures fan out to log + Slack + OTEL spans (kind=Error). No retries. Every report includes:
- Global context from config: `tenant_id`, `environment_id` (when set via env vars)
- Per-check structured attributes: `external_customer_id`, `internal_customer_id`, `wallet_id`, `subscription_id`, `plan_id`, `event_name`, etc. — whichever IDs are known at the point of failure
- `check`, `step`, `run_id`, `error` always present

Set `E2EPROBE_TENANT_ID` and `E2EPROBE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` to make Slack alerts immediately actionable without cross-referencing logs.

## Shutdown

SIGTERM cancels all scheduler contexts; the event-ingest AsyncClient flushes; HTTP listener shuts down cleanly. Graceful shutdown is bounded at 30s.
